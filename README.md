## Testing different merge-sort algorithms

### Description
The work is about implementing and evaluating different merge-sort algorithms. The empirical results show that 2-way and 3way merge-sort do not really differ that much in time complexity, which matches the theoretical conclusion. The augmented 3-way merge-sort is proved analytically to only outperform 3-way merge-sort at small thresholds, but the practical results say otherwise. This contradiction is probably due to the differences in real running time between a recursion and non-recursion algorithm, as one recursion step takes more time and memory than a non-recursion one.
